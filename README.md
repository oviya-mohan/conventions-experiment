[Experimental emergence of conventions in human dyads](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1obkklQVFEC3AdkUI-5yruQi9tnFZXgJW) <br>

Code to run a two-player color-matching coordination task, built using [oTree](https://www.otree.org/)

Four different conditions <br>
Each consists of two sessions - played together in one visit <br>
KEY: <br>
I - Instruction <br>
NI - No Instruction <br>
O - Opaque <br>
T - Transparent <br> 
OT vs TO - denotes order of sessions within I/NI condition <br><br> 

To run locally, download and run via CLI by running otree devserver from the required folder (I_OT, I_TO, NI_OT, NI_TO). To host, build/use .otreezip files via [oTreehub and Heroku](https://www.otreehub.com/)  <br>

For more details on oTree, check documentation [here](https://otree.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).  <br>
